        <h1>My Data Science Project.</h1>

        <p>In the last couple of decades, discoveries of Africa's abundant oil supply have led to intensified global interest and investment opportunities. China’s involvement in the region has increased both economically and politically, with aid fund agreements, concessional loans and heavy investment being the driver of relations. This page aims to explore the incentives driving of China’s rapid increase in economic activity in the region, discussing which countries have been affected the most, and if investment has positively or negatively impacted communities. </p>

        <p>Obtaining of the data used in this project met two main challenges; the first being the reputability of information provided by China on regional investments and the second being the automation of this data. Data and information provided about past and on-going infrastructural projects is often vague or not provided at all, making it difficult to assess the extent of China’s involvement (Brautigam & Hwang, 2019). Often when a reputable data source is found, API’s are either not available or are unstable, making automation challenging. Empirical analysis of these data sets was aimed at illustrating the magnitude of China’s involvement and showing correlation between this and Africa’s economic and social outlook at present. Academic literature and data have often had a tendency of homogenising Africa and discussing it as a singular unit (Chipaike & Bischoff, 2018), whereas in reality the dynamics of Sino-African relations are much more complex, and should be examined at country-level. Whilst maintaining this philosophy in the project was important, visualising fifty-four countries was aesthetically quite challenging, and making sure marks were distinguishable from each other and comprehendible to a reader became a priority in the project. Another challenge this created was the availability of complete data, particularly in data classified by country as often one or more African countries were missing. Whilst this was less of an for showing general time trends, more complex graphs that were trying to indicate potential causal relationships, would’ve been more reputable with data that included all African countries.</p>
