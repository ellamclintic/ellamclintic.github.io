        <h1>My Data Science Project</h1>
        <h2>Has China's investment in Africa affected the region positively?</h2>

        <p>In the last couple of decades, discoveries of Africa's abundant oil supply have led to intensified global interest and investment opportunities. China’s involvement in the region has increased both economically and politically, with aid fund agreements, concessional loans and heavy investment being the driver of relations. This page aims to explore the incentives driving of China’s rapid increase in economic activity in the region, discussing which countries have been affected the most, and if investment has positively or negatively impacted communities. </p>

        <p>Obtaining of the data used in this project met two main challenges; the first being the reputability of information provided by China on regional investments and the second being the automation of this data. Data and information provided about past and on-going infrastructural projects is often vague or not provided at all, making it difficult to assess the extent of China’s involvement (Brautigam & Hwang, 2019). Often when a reputable data source is found, API’s are either not available or are unstable, making automation challenging. Empirical analysis of these data sets was aimed at illustrating the magnitude of China’s involvement and showing correlation between this and Africa’s economic and social outlook at present. Academic literature and data have often had a tendency of homogenising Africa and discussing it as a singular unit (Chipaike & Bischoff, 2018), whereas in reality the dynamics of Sino-African relations are much more complex, and should be examined at country-level. Whilst maintaining this philosophy in the project was important, visualising fifty-four countries was aesthetically quite challenging, and making sure marks were distinguishable from each other and comprehendible to a reader became a priority in the project. Another challenge this created was the availability of complete data, particularly in data classified by country as often one or more African countries were missing. Whilst this was less of an for showing general time trends, more complex graphs that were trying to indicate potential causal relationships, would’ve been more reputable with data that included all African countries.</p>
            

        <h3>Chart 1: GDP growth (current US$)</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart5"></div>

        <p>Chart 1 uses GDP data by year from the World Bank at current US$ prices. This chart aimed to demonstrate the economic rise of many African economies in the last 20 years and to highlight the particular boom of some countries relative to others. Oil extraction and production makes up a substantial part of countries’ GDP growth, and thus it is implicated that China’s investment in this sector is highly influential to its relationship with African nations. African GDP is predicted to increase by 10 times by 2050, and many scholars argue China has an entrepreneurial advantage over other countries – with its relatively new economic status – to support Africa’s development whilst also capitalising off of its growth. China’s economic engagement with Africa has increased rapidly over the last 20 years (Zhao, 2014), and so the base year was set to 2000 to show GDP growth over this time period. The calculations for this were conducted in excel. A tooltip and filter were added to enhance interactivity and enable the reader to distinguish between countries.</p>

        <h3>Chart 2: FDI Stock - by sector</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart6"></div>

        <p>Chart 2 goes deeper into the relationship between China’s investment and Africa’s economies that was introduced in Chart 1, looking at the sectors with the highest FDI from China. Data was obtained from the China Africa Research Initiative which is obtained from Chinese official reports.</p>
        
        <h3>Chart 3: Natural Resources vs FDI</h3>
        <p> <a href="[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O8OjxxQ0gZoEim_FOnvTjmg6spvKt6O-?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O8OjxxQ0gZoEim_FOnvTjmg6spvKt6O-?usp=sharing)" id="link8">link to World Bank API google sheet</a> </p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>

        <p>Chart 3 uses a scatter plot to show potential correlation between China’s FDI with China’s natural resource interest in Africa. The chart uses data obtained from the World Bank API and was cleaned using google collab. The size of the bubbles is used to show GDP per capita of each respective country; perhaps a useful statistic when comparing the relative significance of each country. Whilst the data does not prove causality the R2 value and regression line were calculated in Vega and included to show that there may be a relationship between the two as suggested by many other academic articles (Yu, 2022).</p>

        <h3>Chart 4: Economic Influence vs Positive or Negative Influence</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>

        <p>Chart 4 uses data obtained from a survey conducted by Afrobarometer, where participants were asked to rank China's influence on economy (Question 81a) and if China's influence is positive or negative (Question 81b) on a numerical scale. For each country a mean answer was obtained for each question using data analysis in Excel. The data showed clear positive correlation between the extent of Chinese economic influence and that influence being positive. Chart 5 is a dashboard showing the distribution of positive/negative scores in the survey for each respective country.</p>

        <h3>Chart 5: Histograms of Survey Data</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2"></div>

        <h3>Chart 6: China-Africa FDI Flow</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart4"></div>

        <p>Graph 6 and 7 are geoshapes, both featuring a tooltip, year selector and colour gradient indicating their respective value, with data collected by the China Africa Research Initiative. Chart 7 uses values calculated in Excel, then cleaned in Collab.</p>
